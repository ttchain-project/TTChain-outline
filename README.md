## Introduction
TTChain's core consensus adopts the RDPOSA (Random Delegated Proof of Stake Authority) protocol to provide high-speed and secure solutions, and its interaction with the bottom-level native linear smart time-lock mechanism enables it to realize the following three cross-chain features:

(1) Complete transaction confirmation of parallel chains: Establish high-speed relay mode through sub-chain channels and the principles of hash native linear time-lock protocols.

(2) A high-speed response process which maintains the total assets of both chains. 

(3) Ensuring the independence and security of both chains: Realizing the offline signature, security authentication and multiple signatures of authentication nodes.
